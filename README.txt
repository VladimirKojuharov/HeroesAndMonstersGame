HeroesAndMonsters

This java project is a console based game where the player has to choose between one of three character types (Mage, Fighter and Rogue) 
each with their own unique base stats (Life, Life Regain, Armor, Shield, Damage, Attack Speed, Crit Chance, Stun Chance, Spell Power, 
Magic Resistance, Mana, Mana Regeneration).

In the process of playing the game, the player will gain experience and LEVEL UP, change his stats, choose from many different spells 
to master (Heal, Fireball, Stone Skin, Mana Burn, Blind, Blizzard, Slow, Stun Strike, Haste, Life Drain), each with its own unique effect.
Choosing which one to use must be careful because each caste can only be casted once during a battle (unless learned multiple times).

He/She will have to carefully select her opponents throughout all 40 levels. For each battle, there will be a choice between three 
creatures which, depending on the stage of the game it is in, can be:
 - 14 types of common monsters
 - 8 types of champions
 - 5 different final bosses
(Each of enemies has different unique skills and spells, and different stats that change depending on their own level)

After each victory, the hero will be given the right to choose rewards, representing different types of equipment (at this stage - 
weapons, armor, boots, helmets) to equip to improve his performance.
Each type of gear has individual stats (from 4 for helmets and boots, 5 for weapons and 8 for armor)

The weapons themselves also vary in 7 different types (Axes, Hammers, Swords, Bows, Staffs, Crossbows, and Scepters), each with its 
own advantages based on its type.
	

I recommend making your console 24 lines when playing it.
